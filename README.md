Test codes for master's thesis: "Comparing Performance of String Operations Across Programming Languages"

Note that the biggest string size (100 million characters) was too big to upload on Git, so create your own string size of 100 million characters if you want to test the code with the biggest string size. See the thesis for instructions on how the strings were generated. 

In case you want to test the code, please note that at the time being all operations among source code is commented. Uncomment any operation that you want to test.

After each run, use avg-times.py-file to calculate the average values for the run.

For testing memory usages, see the thesis on how memory usages were tested.
