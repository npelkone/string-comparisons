Test codes for master's thesis: "Comparing Performance of String Operations Across Programming Languages"

Note that the repository holds only the test codes and the strings used for testing (generated with Python); you'll have to make your own scripts for getting the average values. Also, the biggest string size (100 million characters) was too big to upload on Git, so create your own string size of 100 million characters if you want to test the code with the biggest string size. See the thesis for instructions on how the strings were generated.
